A collection of JavaScript Best Practices

![Fit vs Fat](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/javascript-best-practice/master/images/fit-vs-fat.jpg "Fit vs Fat")

Much like being in shape, 
writing *consistent*, *maintainable* and *performant* code
does not have to be "*aspiration*", its a *decision* we make
and stick to. If you see someone writing junk, share this with them! 


### Short List

1. *Use* the “**Good Parts**” (and *avoid* the “*Bad parts*”)
2. **Clear**, **Concise** and **Commented** Code
3. **Meaningful Variable Names** (Especially as Parameters)
4. *Avoid* **Global** Variables
5. Use **JSLint** to ensure your code is consistent.
6. *Always* **Unit Test** your Code (even for simple/quick fixes and one-liners)
7. *Learn* (“Real”/”Raw”) JavaScript (fundamentals) before using Libraries like JQuery/Backbone
8. Avoid Libraries/Modules/Frameworks until you *understand* them. especially when they are un-tested/documented if(tests===false) alert(“Don’t use it!”) … 
9. **Never Commit**/Ship **Broken**/Buggy **Code** even when “PMs” Pressure You!
10. Its only “**Done**” when its “**Documented**”.

### Extra Mile

11. Learn **CoffeeScript** it will Set you Free!
12. Learn & Use **Patterns**
13. (Don’t be afraid to) *Critique* someone else’s code if they ignore any coding best practices (by pointing to the *specific* “guideline” that is not being followed)
14. Compile your code with **Source Maps** (to aid debugging)




My ambition is to write a *system* that lints JavaScript code during build
and rejects code that does not adhere to these best practices.

### History

This originally started out in a Google Doc:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t9msoVNY5KlRnHeIAgUgqDyaXh2Q35v5zHtdpZ2vy-U
I created it to share/suggest best practices with my team of developers.
The idea was that all developers in the company could edit the doc and a 
generally agreed code for writing code could be established.

The *reality* was that I was the only one who even *looked* at the Google Doc!
Nobody made any comments or contributions. :-(
*Too "Busy"* coding to stop and think: "*Is my code consistent...?*" or 
"*Is this maintainable by someone else?*" ... This is not the time or place 
to voice my *frustration* at trying to get people in an established 
organisation (with more **bad habits** than you can *imagine*) to adopt 
industry best practices for JavaScript code. 
Each to their own. 

Its time to put this up on GitHub for a wider audience to access. ;-)

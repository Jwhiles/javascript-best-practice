javascript-best-practice
========================

A collection of JavaScript Best Practices



### History

This originally started out in a Google Doc:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t9msoVNY5KlRnHeIAgUgqDyaXh2Q35v5zHtdpZ2vy-U
I created it to share/suggest best practices with my team of developers.
The idea was that all developers in the company could edit the doc and a 
generally agreed code for writing code could be established.

The reality was that I was the only one who even looked at the document!
Nobody edited it or made any comments or contributions. 
*Too "Busy"* coding to stop and think: "*Is my code consistent...?*" or 
"*Is this maintainable by someone else?*" ... This is not the time or place 
to voice my *frustration* at trying to get people in an established 
organisation(with more **bad habits** than you can *imagine*) to adopt 
industry best practices when it comes to JavaScript code. 
Each to their own.

Its time to put this up on GitHub for a wider audience to access. ;-)

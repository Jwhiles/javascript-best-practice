javascript-best-practice
========================

A collection of JavaScript Best Practices



#### History

This originally started out in a Google Doc:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t9msoVNY5KlRnHeIAgUgqDyaXh2Q35v5zHtdpZ2vy-U
I created it to share/suggest best practices with my team of developers.
The idea was that all developers in the company could edit the doc and a 
generally agreed code for writing code could be established.
